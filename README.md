# Inspirify

Sick of listening to the same favourite artists everyday? Inspirify is the app you are looking to find music that suits your tastes. Inspirify searches for artists similar to your favourite artist to give recommendations that will inspire you. Once you have found your inspiration you can click on the artist/band you are interested in and view their biography, as well as listen to a sample of their top songs. All recommendations are provided courtesy of Spotify and me! :)

To use Inspirify:

1. Enter your favourite artist in the search box and click 'Inspire Me' or press enter
2. A list of recommendations based on the artist/band entered in the search.
3. To view more about the artist/band you are interested in click on box that corresponds to their name and a popup will show you their biography and top songs.
4. You can click on the 'Play' button to play a sample of their top song.

Happy Listening!
